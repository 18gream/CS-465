# Architecture

# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  When building this full-stack web application, I used Express HTML, JavaScript and SPA. Express was used to render HTML pages for the login and admin page. JavaScript was used in the project to handle data and UI aspects wihtout needing to reload the page.
  SPA was used to create a smoother transition because it allows the page to update without reloading the entire page. This allowed for an all-around efficient and effective user expierence. MongoDB was used for the backend because it can store data structures
  easier than others. MongoDB stores its data in BSON and this integrates with JavaScript on the frontend, allowing for data transfers to be easier overall. 

# Functionality

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  JSON stores and transfers data, while JavaScript is a programming language that contains logic. In this project, a user will submit a form and the frontend sends/receives data in JSON format. On the backend (JavaScript), 
  Express takes those forms, processes them, and then sends them back using JSON. I often reused JavaScript language that could be used throughout the frontend. For the backend, I reused logic for error handling. The benefits to reusable UI components 
  are efficiency and consistency throughout the project. 

# Testing

# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
  Using tools like Postman allowed for accurately testing API endpoints through the development process. Sending requests (methods) through Postman like GET, PUT and POST to view their responses allowed me to ensure my development was correctly working. The endpoints are the 
  URLs that are on the server that handle the requests mentioned previously. Security in a full stack application involves creating authorization within the application to ensure protection. An example of this within the application is a login for the admin page. 

# Reflection

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
  This course has gave me more knowledge on how to build a functional full stack web application. It deepened my knowledge on APIs, endpoints and how SPA development, JavaScript, Express and MongoDB databases all work together to create a web application. 
  This course has helped me become more organized with my code structure and problem-solving skills.
